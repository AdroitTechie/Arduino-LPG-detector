# LPG Leakage detector and alarm Using SMS Alert

 In this project We have Used Arduino UNO and GSM module along with LPG gas leakage detecting sensor MQ-5. We have also included sound alarm in this project.MQ-5 can be used for detecting gas leakage in commercial and industrial purposes. Along with LPG, this sensor detects Methane, carbonMonoxide and alcohol. The output voltage from the gas Sensor increases when the concentration of gas increases. Sensitivity can be adjusted by varying the potentiometer.Arduino uno is used in the project.GSM modules used is sim900a.Sim900a can be used for making call and message.Our project costs Rs.2,450 which is half when compared to other devices prices.



 We have used a LPG gas sensor module to detect LPG Gas, When LPG gas leakage occurs, It activates buzzer which beeps again and again untuil the gas detector module doesn't sense the gas in its given range.And also send situation message for respective devices with all details.

### The Main components of Project are:
*  Arduino
*  GSM Module of Sim900a
*  MQ-5 sensor

Its built in C programming Language
